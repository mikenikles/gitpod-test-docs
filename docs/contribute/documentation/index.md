# Contribute Documentation

Gitpod has a dedicated team that looks after our documentation. You can help improve our documentation by:

- Using the feedback widget at the bottom of each page in our documentation. All feedback is recorded into a spreadsheet and we use this information to drive the process to improve the Gitpod documentation.
- Submitting documentation updates via the "Edit on Gitpod button" (top right on every page) when you learn something that you think other developers would also benefit from.

We ðŸ§¡ the people who are involved in this project, and weâ€™d love to help you with onboarding. Drop by the `#contributing` channel on the [Gitpod Discord server](https://www.gitpod.io/chat) and _ask for help_.
