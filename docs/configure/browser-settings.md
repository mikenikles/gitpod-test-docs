# Browser Settings

For the best experience when working with Gitpod, we recommend you whitelist the `.gitpod.io` domain in your browser for the following permissions:

- Paste content from your clipboard to a Gitpod workspace
- Pop-ups, to preview your dev server in a new tab

Each browser handles this slightly differently:

- [Chrome](#chrome)
- [Edge](#edge)
- [Brave](#brave)
- [Firefox](#firefox)
- [Safari](#safari)
